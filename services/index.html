          <h5>The Ryss Lab Approach</h5>
          <div class="col-md-8">
            <p>Ryss Lab takes several steps to ensure that all our clients' needs and concerns are met, such as entering mutual confidentiality agreements, taking the client to tour the lab's facilities to gain a first-hand understanding of where the project will be worked on, and working closely with the client to get continuous input on the project's progress.</p>
            
            <p>Once our team members have gained a thorough understanding of the project's scope, scale, and objectives, we will submit a written proposal, along with prices quoted for an <span>upon product delivery</span> or a <span>contract-based full time equivalent (FTE)</span>. Once this has been approved, our scientists will begin working. Throughout the process, we will continue to actively engage the client in the project's progress. For contract research and development (R&D) projects in particular, clients will receive interim progress reports and/or attend in-person meetings.</p>

            <h6>Standard Protocol</h6>
            <p>Our scientists follow industry standards and practices for laboratory work. Records are faithfully generated and carefully stored, as according to established standard operating procedures (SOP). When producing materials for clinical trials, our scientists additionally follow guidelines for good manufacturing practices (GMP) - they are fully aware of the new FDA IHC Q7A guidelines.</p>

            <p>Prior to product delivery, our independent quality checker will certify product purity to ensure that the client's exact specifications are met. Product purity is usually checked with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and other such analytical procedures.</p>
